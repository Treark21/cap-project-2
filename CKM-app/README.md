# cap-project-2
 2nd idea for project and building


Overview:
I want to make an E-commerce site that will provide commission painters to show their works, have a gallery of items that show the differnet levels in painting for people to select from, and then to have a submission form to contact the painter with what they would like to have done and at what level for a quote. The idea came from knowing a few commission painters and knowing their need for a website beyond just a facebook page

Features:

    User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. User login will change site layout and allow for use of the quote form
    Multiple pages: gallery of works as well as a gallery of commission types and possible pricing
    Contact forms: On seperate pages we have differnet contact forms, both send an email through Twilio SendGrid to Owner email 
    

Technologies:

    HTML & CSS
    JavaScrip
    Firebase
    Bootstrap 4
    Angular
    SendGrid

 I will need to learn how to add a user database that can be referenced by the login form and validated,how to add different types of users, how to redirect the user profile page based on the type of user, use of Angular to add an enhanced framework, as well as work mutiple pages. I will also need to learn how to add communication to the painter
