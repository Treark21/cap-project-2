# cap-project-2
 2nd idea for project and building


Overview:
I want to make an E-commerce site that will provide commission painters to show their works, have a gallery of items that show the differnet levels in painting for people to select from, and then to have a submission form to contact the painter with what they would like to have done and at what level for a quote. The idea came from knowing a few commission painters and knowing their need for a website beyond just a facebook page

Features:

    User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page. Possibly more then one user type and a redirect upon sign in for different types
    Multiple pages: gallery of works as well as a gallery of commission types and possible pricing
    Checkout: have a dedicated form that allows for users to contact the painter, with fields for things to be painted at which level, as well as possible ability to upload photos for color scheme or ideas. This form will be recived and then replied to, which should show in the user profile
    Payment API: adding a payment API to allow user to pay after accepting quote from painter

Technologies:

    HTML & CSS
    JavaScrip
    MySQL
    Bootstrap 4
    AngularJS

 I will need to learn how to add a user database that can be referenced by the login form and validated,how to add different types of users, how to redirect the user profile page based on the type of user, use of AngularJS to add an enhanced framework, as well as work mutiple pages. I will also need to learn how to add communication to the painter to user profiles as well as adding a payment API
